# NewsReader
A News Aggregator that pulls information from the most common news sites.
INSPIRATION - You are about to embark on a long flight and you don't want to pay for inflight wifi. However, you'd like to keep up with news from your favorite websites. Well, here you go, lol.
This news aggregator pulls news from the RSS feeds of the most popular news websites. It is currently configured for CNN, Huffington post and Washington Post. The user could pick specific sections like Tech, Business sports etc. The program then downloads all the news from these sections in the last 24 hours and stores on a MySQL local database. The user could then read all the news on the application.
Special Feature - The program is able to read the news out loud to the user. This feature was implemented using the FreeTTS speech synthesizer. I hope to add more features and make the news display cleaner. Feel free to download and use. ;)
